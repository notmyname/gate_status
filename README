Generate a URL to see how successful the OpenStack CI gates have been.

These graphs optimistically assume that no data == 100% success.

This big, bold red line is the chance that a newly-submitted patch has of
passing the six main gate jobs, even if it is perfect code with no bugs. Since
there are more than siz gate jobs, this is a best-case scenario.

The calculation is done by time-bucketing the success rate of the individual
jobs. Then these percentages are multiplied together to get the overall chance
of success (gate failures are independent).

Files:
 * graph_url: a formatted version of the graphite URL
 * build_page.py: makes a simple webpage, gate_status.html with the URL

Usage:
 * edit graph_url
 * `python ./build_page.py`
 * open gate_status.html
